# DEVELOPER: Include this at the top of your script before your other code.
# You can customize this and override the text and code in here.
# Shared content and functionality will continue to be worked on and improved,
# as well as translated, so it might be worth keeping what you can.

# TODO: Prevent original device from accidentally opening the signature page?
# TODO: Allow user to explicitly go back to their original device.
# TODO: Add error message for wrong number
# TODO: Provide email option too?
# TODO: `task_not_yet_performed('send signature link')` - allow only one sending of the link?
---
# If needed, offer them a way to send the link to another device.
# Direct them to the signature.

  Many smartphones will automatically find the picture on this screen when you use the camera app. The link may "float" up from the screen into a small icon you can tap. If your phone does not do this, text yourself a link instead.
